I’m **r0keb**, a low-level explorer focused on the raw mechanics that power modern computing. I try to work as close to the metal as possible (excluding hardware hacking).

## What I’m into:

- Low-Level Engineering: Assembly, memory layouts, CPU state. Understanding the system from its foundations.

- Windows Kernel: I spend time with undocumented internals, reverse engineering, and kernel-mode development.

- Exploit Development: I study vulnerability classes, build POCs, and analyze exploitation techniques, mostly on Windows.

- Intel Architecture: From x86 to x64 and beyond. I dissect instruction sets, CPU behavior, and architectural quirks to better understand performance and potential.

⟁ I write technical posts, notes, and deep dives into the topics above.
If you’re into systems internals, low-level debugging, or kernel-level research, feel free to take a [look](https://r0keb.github.io/).

# üåë r0keb üåë
> _‚ÄúThe hypervisor always whispers the truth.‚Äù_

I‚Äôm **r0keb**, a low-level explorer focused on the raw mechanics that power modern computing. Trying to work as closest to the metal as possible. (except hardware hacking)

## ‚ú¶ What I‚Äôm into:

- üîß Low-Level Sorcery: Assembly, memory layouts, CPU state. Understanding the system from its foundations.

- ‚öô Windows Kernel: I spend time with undocumented internals, reverse engineering, and kernel-mode development.

- üî• Exploit Development: I study vulnerability classes, build POCs, and analyze exploitation techniques, mostly on Windows.

- ‚è≥ Intel Architecture: From x86 to x64 and beyond ‚Äî I dissect instruction sets, CPU behavior, and architectural quirks to better understand performance and potential.

‚üÅ I write technical posts, notes, and deep dives into the topics above.
If you‚Äôre into systems internals, debugging rituals, or kernel-level research, feel free to take a [look](https://r0keb.github.io/).
